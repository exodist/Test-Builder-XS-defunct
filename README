name
    Test::Builder::XS - XS Enhancement library for Test::Builder

DESCRIPTION
    Some parts of Test::Builder are very slow in pure perl code. Recent
    updates to Test::Builder have almost doubled the time it takes for the
    perl test suite to complete. This module is an attempt to maintain
    performance without sacrificing capabilities.

EXPORTS
    $trace = tb_trace()
        Returns an Test::Builder::Trace object comprised of
        Test::Builder::Trace::Frame objects. XS is used to build the entire
        stack trace to ensure performance.

    more to come
        There are plans to add other XS code as necessary
